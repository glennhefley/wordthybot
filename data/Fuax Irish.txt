were almost swamped
ships 
will be sunk
they were shipwrecked
submerged
whatever may have been drowned in them
if they drown someone
that they were in fact drowned
excommunicated them
enmities were quenched
would not be obliterated
how the glory of the place
I have undertaken
truth will be uttered
to which I refer
every noble form 
is judged by comparison with mine
I invoke
springing away towards 
allowing them 

springs towards it
they spring away northwards
died suddenly
trout leaping
lowing
cry
following the hue and cry
bleating


tops of green birch as 
winding-sheets
about him
tow pressed together
tow
an armful of hards of flax
where is his superior
from 
that blunting
driven
better than whom nobody overcomes 
an enemy
pierces, nails; shoes
all who pierced
from the surplus of wine


from the surplus of wine
 . . . is good
of corn
of trees


before making any 
move
impulse
 (with) each oar-stroke that he gave the curach,
vigorously propelled
made for
did not retreat
surpassed
degree
decided the 
amount
impulsive 
valour
rout
diadem
a slight wound
bite or sup
the slightest trace of disease
very little compared with what is to follow
running ulcer
cream
a milch cow


bend
enclosed corner
angle
field
nape 
of the neck
the lame made 
to walk
goes lame
without hindering its being divided 
or measured
not to prevent you from
who is prevented by
they must not be given
I stopped him from the plunder
to lighten her sorrow
they hinder 
our prayers from being heard by God
blindness, deafness, lameness
disablement, impairment
stiffness, awkwardness


after swearing by . . . a crozier
the clerk who carried his staff
are making them a false support
D. is taking orders
assumed the pilgrim's staff
a promise to go on a pilgrimage
a bondman
